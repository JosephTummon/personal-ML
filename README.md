## Personal Machine Learning projects.
Working through Andrej Karpathy playlist of YouTube videos on building neural networks from scratch.
These videos are an excellent educational tool and would highly advise them to anyone looking to learn about about Machine Learning.

These will be side projects outside of work so will update this repo when I have the time.
The current goal is to work through the set of videos and after creating each model I'll either try fine tune it a bit more or apply it to a different use case.
